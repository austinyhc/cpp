# Dynamic Programming


## When do we use DP?
1. Count something, often the number of ways
2. Minimize or maximize certain value
3. YES/NO questions

1.) can be categorized as Combinatorics
- `Combinatorics` is an area of mathematics primarily concerned with counting, both as a means and an end in obtaining results, and certain properties of finite structures.
2.) and 3.) can be categorized as Greedy?

## Iteration vs. Recurseion
### Iteration
- Speed
- Easier complexity
- Shorter code
- Harder techniques
### Recursion
- Easier to apply
- Fewer states
- Order does not matter
